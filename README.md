Simple Day Calendar

A daily planner developed using JavaScript, BootStrap (CSS) and Jquery

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day.This project started with starter code with instructions to modify. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

One requirement was to use [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) or an alternative date/time API. I choose to use Moment even though it is soon to be discontinued.

The user is able to enter events in the input col and save those events in local storage. 


Lanquages / Technoligies:

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Moment.js
-Bootstrap
